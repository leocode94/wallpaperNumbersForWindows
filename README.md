# wallpaperNumbersForWindows

This code was written using the Python programming language. Its purpose is to rename files on a Linux directory based on their extensions.

I've always wanted to rename my wallpapers assigning random numbers to each one of them within a certain range, as a way to keep everything organized.

In order to use the program:

- Open the file on a text editor
- Edit the location of your folder on the "directory" variable
- Type the extensions you want to manipulate in the "if" statements (delete those you won't use)
- Edit the final message of sucess.
